# leads-extension

This is a simple chrome extension I have built using Vanilla JavaScript.

This application will allow the user to save links and tabs from various different websites across the web for easy access. This extension functions similar to that of a bookmark bar. The data is stored within localStorage so the user can close the extension and reopen it to still have access to all the saved links. If the user would like to restart they can clear the extension deleting all previous stored information from localStorage.

There currently still is a bug with the tab functionality where the information is being stored as undefined.
